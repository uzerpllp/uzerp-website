draft: true
---

*Last Updated: 12 March 2019*

VAT-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the VAT threshold are required to use the Making Tax Digital service to keep records digitally and use software to submit their VAT returns from 1 April 2019.

uzERP's VAT module has been updated to enable commercially supported customers to submit their VAT returns directly from uzERP to HMRC.

## Your Responsibilities

When you submit VAT information from uzERP software you are making a legal declaration that the information is true and complete. A false declaration can result in prosecution. It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that VAT information submitted to HMRC from uzERP software is correct.

uzERP LLP maintains application credentials that allow your uzERP software to interact with HMRC in the process of submitting VAT returns.

* You must not disclose our application credentials to any third-party.
* If you think that our application credentials have been disclosed to an unauthorised third-party, you must let us know immediately.

## Our Responsibilities

From time to time, we may change our application credentials. When we do this, we will update all supported customers with the new credentials. You will need to re-authorise uzERP to submit your VAT returns after we have changed our credentials.
