## About Talon  Engineering Limited

Talon Engineering has been in business for over 40 years and is still privately owned.

Specialising in high specification motorcycle parts and having 75 world champions relying on their equipment, the company has a deserved reputation for excellence. With a large share of the business being for export, and a dizzying array of products, options and end-user applications, this is a complex and fast moving company working in a highly visible sector.

In addition to motorcycle parts, Talon also manufacture high quality engineered items for aerospace, automotive and general engineering applications to customer specifications.

## Sales and Logistics

Initially Talon were looking for a solution to their order processing issues. 

Key features of the uzERP implementation:

* High volume of orders from many customers;
* Stock and build to order execution;
* "Trade counter" type functionality;
* Customised workflow allowing pick lists and stock reservations by department;
* Pricing by 'catalogue' type for different markets;
* Features and options including colour, specification variations selectable at order entry.

## Product Selector

A product selector module was developed allowing end-user applications (by manufacturer, model and year in Talon's case) to be stored and matched to items in the catalogue meaning advice can be given to customers as to what parts are available with confidence.

## Accounting

Talon uses the full suite of accounting applications and benefits from the tight inetgration with Sales and Purchasing workflows.

* Trade counter receipts by credit card are posted during order processing and captured in the accounting system to the correct merchant account.
* Accurate Debtors and Creditors ledgers allow cash flow and business forecasting

## Management Information

A series of custom reports covering Sales, Operations, Planning and Accounting provide Talon with information in a timely and accurate manner. Some of this is delivered via Pivot Tables in MS-Excel - automatic updates of these tables are achieved using ODBC connections meaning no-re-keying is required.

Lately, a series of on-line 'dashboards' have been developed fed directly from the uzERP database to monitor business performance using the Redash web-based analytics system.
