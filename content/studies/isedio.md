## About Isedio Limited

Isedio was started a decade ago by Shaun Spurrell, Owner and Managing Director, to manufacture products for use in the casting of commercial and industrial concrete floors.

By the summer of 2015 the company was growing steadily, with an expanding client base in the UK and overseas buying an increasingly diverse range of products. Shaun had also taken the first steps to expanding internationally using a stockholder in the Middle East and opening an Australian subsidiary based in Sydney.

At this time the company had disparate systems with a range of spreadsheets/documents stored in a 'folder based' project management system, supported by a single user accounting package.

## Initial requirements

It was clear to Shaun that in order to develop Isedio in the way he wanted he had to get control of the both the purchasing and sales order process so that he and his team had visibility of the forward workload and committed orders for raw materials and components.

uzERP was chosen as it offered the opportunity to implement only the Purchase and Sales Order processing initially but with an eye on integration in other areas.

Step 1 was to implement the order processing and inbound (good received) and outbound logistics modules, including development of a custom document for each Sales Order - the "Instruction to Manufacture" - which allowed the company to retain the existing workflow. Further, the uzERP Project Management module was used to group both sales and Purchase orders together allowing management to see the status of customer site based projects where multiple orders were placed.
