This is the first of what will be a series of blog posts on the new uzERP site.

uzERP has now been in production use for over 10 years at Severn Delta Limited but we still have loads we want to do with the system. There are a few key updates in the pipeline and I'll share details of these here on the blog.

In addition Iâ€™ll be putting together posts on a variety of topics relating to using uzERP to improve your business processes as well as articles on general business topics and things we come across that catch our attention or that we think you might find interesting.
