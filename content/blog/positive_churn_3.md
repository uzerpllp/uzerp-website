> I went to the Zoo on Tuesday and became trapped in the Lemur enclosure with Ilan Nissim , Supply Chain Director from Reckitt Benckiser Israel. 
> 
> Whilst trapped with the Lemurs Ilan and I talked business of course. He is concerned that I think too much like a marketer and not enough like a manufacturer. I countered this by saying that I am very much a manufacturer but that Variable Labour Cost Does not Exist.

> An Error message from his brain caused much frowning and furrowing of the brow. So I explained another of Martyn and Clive's fundamental theories of survival.

> For the most part we employ our manufacturing people on permanent full time contracts. This means they are paid for being employed. If we have orders for 1 million units a month they are employed to make 1 million units a month. If we have orders for zero we still have to pay them. They are a fixed cost so we treat ALL people costs as... Total People Costs, and as an "Overhead".

> 
> "Are we delivering the budget volumes." I asked knowing that the allocations were included at rates established in the annual "Budget".
> 
> "Yes"
> 
> "And do we have the same number of people as budgeted?"
> 
> "Yes"
> 
> "And we have the capacity with current head count?"
> 
> "Yes"
> 
> "Then the labour cost for this extra business is Zero."

> "?" Error message.
