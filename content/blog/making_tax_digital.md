uzERP is the only (as far as we are aware) Open Source system available that is compliant with the HMRC Making Tax Digital for VAT standard which must be used from 1st April 2019.

## Background
[Making Tax Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital) is the HMRC project to force companies to submit tax returns online. 

From the HMRC website...

> VAT-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the VAT threshold are required to use the Making Tax Digital service to keep
> records digitally and use software to submit their VAT returns from 1 April 2019.

More information on the procedure is here https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-software-to-submit-your-vat-returns

## Open Source?

There is a list of suppliers MTD for VAT [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates) - but as far as we are aware none of them are open source.

uzERP is therefore the __ONLY__ option if you want an Open Source solution.
