## Background

[Making Tax Digital for VAT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital) is the HMRC project to require companies to submit VAT returns online.

From the HMRC website...

> VAT-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the VAT threshold are required to use the Making Tax Digital service to keep
> records digitally and use software to submit their VAT returns from 1 April 2019.

More information on the procedure is here https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-software-to-submit-your-vat-returns

## Open Source

HMRC publishes a list of software suppliers with systems compliant with MTD for VAT [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates) - however, as far as we are aware, none of them are Open Source.

uzERP is therefore the __ONLY__ option if you want an Open Source solution that allows you to submit compliant VAT returns without using 3rd party software (commonly known as a 'Bridge') after 1st April 2019.
