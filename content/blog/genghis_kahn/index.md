This is another book that I believe is a must read for all Entrepreneurs.

__The Genghis Khan Guide To Business__ is a great introduction to the 'Financial Dynamics' of business for Finance and Non Financial managers alike.

Back in the early '90s I was introduced to Brian Warnes, the author of *__Genghis__*, when he was consulting at a company where I worked. I was very, very impressed by him and his methods and I have to confess that, as a professional accountant, he changed the way I thought about financial control for manufacturing by sacrificing many of the sacred cows passed down from my formal accountancy training.

I was lucky enough to run into him again at a [MARG conference](http://www.lse.ac.uk/accounting/events/marg/management-accounting-research-group) in the mid 2000s and was made up by the fact that he remembered me at all. We had a wonderful chat and he was genuinely pleased to hear I'd taken on much of what we'd talked about - and that I was applying many of his ideas in my own small manufacturing business as noted [here](/blog/2019/04/01/positive_churn_intro/).

I had only limited time with him but found Brian to be a gentleman and an inspiration - he is, sadly, no longer with us, but his legacy lives on in the book and the effect it had on those that met him and took on board his insights.

### Book Details
Very much of its time - after all it was written 35 years ago - the book is still relevant today and I believe should be made standard reading for all prospective managers in business.
