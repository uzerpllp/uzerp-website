A fortnightly roundup of all the latest news from uzERP LLP plus articles and information on issues that I think will be of interest to SMEs. Iâ€™ll be putting together articles on a variety of subjects including 

* News items and snippets from the UK SME scene
* General business topics
* Using Open Source software in your SME
* How uzERP and other applications can be used to improve your business processes

Plus we'll include a roundup of links to resources we come across that catch our attention, or that we think you might find interesting.
