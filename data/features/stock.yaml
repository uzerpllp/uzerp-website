 #### Managing stock is managing money....

 ....and money should be kept in your bank account not in the warehouse.

 
 For manufacturers and wholesalers stock is the heart of the commercial system - the uzERP Stock module can be used to track all aspects of your organisationâ€™s stock and work-in- progress which means keeping you up to speed with where the money is!

 #### uzERP can keep track of
 
  *  Item master details

 *  Item balances across warehouses/locations/bins

 *  Stock movements

 *  Units of measure (e.g. how may packs in a case)

 *  Product structures and routes for manufactured and sub-contracted items

 *  Links to works orders, sales orders and purchase orders


 #### Custom workflow

 It is possible to map the relationships between stores and locations within your organisation to produce a view of how stock moves through the business.
