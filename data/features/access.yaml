 #### Web based

 uzERP is a web based application accessible from any PC or Mac using a browser - no client software is required.

 #### Always on the go?

 When away from the office, businesses require employees to have instant access to systems - uzERP can be 'cloud-hosted' and therefore gives you access to all business information anytime and from anywhere.... meaning you always have access to real-time business insights.

 #### Integration

 It is easy and cost effective to add satellite offices and facilitate home working.... which helps to integrate geographically dispersed operations.

 Our use of an open source, standards compliant, database allows us to connect up spreadsheets and external browser/app based reporting systems.
