 #### uzERP helps you respond to customers while managing fullfillment and cashflow

  The best way to improve cash flow while maintaining a high level of service, is to take orders accurately, ship quickly using customer preference, avoid mistakes in billing, and have
 reporting to signal slow payers. This all sounds simple, but without modern automated systems, these tasks are time-consuming and prone to errors.

 #### Integrated systems reduce errors and the time it takes to receive cash from a sale

 Customer orders can be automated in many ways, including websites, phone orders, and point-of-sale devices. The system can automatically apply discounts, display item availability, and
 offer delivery options. Orders are then sent to shipping and invoiced—without requiring the initial information to be rekeyed by a human.

 #### Speed payment through accurate invoicing

 uzERP provides flexibility and accuracy with invoicing by offering flexible terms and conditions, contracts, deferred billing, and recurring billing to meet your customer’s needs.
 In cases when the customer is slow to pay, visual dashboards can alert the customer service team to inquire about the issue before it becomes a significant problem.
