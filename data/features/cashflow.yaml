 #### uzERP helps you respond to customers while managing fullfillment and cashflow

 The best way to improve cash flow while maintaining a high level of service, is to take orders accurately, deliver on-time in-full, avoid mistakes in billing, and have
 reporting to signal slow payers. This all sounds straightforward, but without modern automated systems, these tasks are time-consuming and prone to errors.

 #### Integrated systems reduce errors and the time it takes to receive cash from a sale

 Customer orders can be automated in many ways, including websites, phone orders, and point-of-sale devices. uzERP can automatically apply discounts, display item availability, and
 offer delivery options. Pick lists and despatch paperwork can be produced and orders invoiced—without requiring the initial information to be rekeyed.

 #### Speed payment through accurate invoicing

 uzERP provides flexibility and accuracy with invoicing by offering flexible terms and conditions, and recurring transactions to meet your customer’s needs.
 In cases when a customer is slow to pay, visual dashboards can alert the customer service team to inquire about the issue before it becomes a significant problem.

 #### Forecasting

 Using due date reporting for both receipts and payments accurate cash flow forecasts can be built showing when pressure on finances may be building, allowing corrective action to be taken ahead of time.
