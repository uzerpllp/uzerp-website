 #### Managing stock is managing money

 In some senses the Stock (inventory) system is the heart of the commercial system if you are a manufacturer or wholesaler, since every aspect of the business will be related back to a stock item is some way.
 
 The uzERP Stock module can be used to track all aspects of your organisationâ€™s stock and work-in- progress - which means keeping you up to speed with where the money is!

 #### uzERP can keep track of
  *  Item master details

 *  Item balances across warehouses/locations/bins

 *  Stock movements

 *  Units of measure (e.g. how may packs in a case)

 *  Product structures and routes for manufactured and sub-contracted items

 *  Links to works orders, sales orders and purchase orders


 #### Custom workflow

 It is possible to map the relationships between stores and locations within each organisation to produce a view of how stock moves between them and therefore through the business.
