 #### Why uzERP

 uzERP is an Open Source modular business system designed for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME). 
 
 The system includes functionality that touches every business function

  *  “Order to cash” processing for both the sales and purchase processes including trade counter operations
  
  *  Manufacturing execution and shop floor data collection
 
 *  Stock Management with multi location Warehousing
 
 *  Financial Ledgers – Sales, Purchase and General Ledger plus Cash Book

 * HR module
 
 *  Innovative drag and drop report writer
 


 The Open Source nature of uzERP means that a business can implement modules that are applicable to their environment. Since the software itself is essentially free, organisations can implement uzERP in a phased way without the ‘big bang’ approach needed to get a quick payback from traditional upfront license fees.
