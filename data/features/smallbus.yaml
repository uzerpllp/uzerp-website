 #### Open Source
 
  Built using open source tools, uzERP is a suite of business software that delivers big company functionality on a small company budget. With no
 upfront license costs you only pay for the implementation and support you require - therefore running your business with uzERP puts you in
 control of the cost.

 #### Designed for all businesses... that just happen to be small
 
 The lead designers on the uzERP team include experienced directors of SME manufacturing businesses, in addition to accountancy and IT professionals.
 uzERP was designed and built inside a SME manufacturing business, and supports Make-to-Stock, Make-to-Order and Process environments but is equally 
 suited to Service Businesses.

 Don't bee fooled, though - uzERP can scale to be as big as you want!
