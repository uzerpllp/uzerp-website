 #### Open Source
 
  Built using open source tools, uzERP is a suite of business software that delivers big company functionality on a small company budget. With no
 upfront license costs you only pay for the implementation and support you require - therefore running your business with uzERP puts you in
 control of the cost.

 #### Designed for all businesses... that just happen to be small
 
 Just because you are an SME doesn't mean your operation isn't complex and fast moving.


 The lead designers on the uzERP team include experienced directors of SME manufacturing businesses, in addition to accountancy and IT professionals.
 uzERP was designed and built inside a small manufacturing business, and supports Make-to-Stock, Make-to-Order and Process environments but is equally 
 suited to Service Businesses.


 Don't be fooled, though - uzERP is a robust system and can scale up as you grow so you won't have to change systems at a later date.
